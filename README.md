# Node.js Random Color Generator

Generate random colors in CLI

When entering a specific command in the command line, a block of approximately 31x9 # characters and of a random color (using hex code, e.g. #ff0000) should be generated.

Also, it should be able to request for a hue (e.g. green or red or blue) or luminosity (e.g. light or dark),
and then generate random colors that match those choices.
